This is the source code for the popular TreeView Control for OneNote.(http://tabletpcstudent.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/treeview/) Please note that this source code has NOT been cleaned up/made easy for public consumption. I decided to abandon this project, and therefore am releasing the code so that others can hack/fix bugs if they want to. Feel free to email me if you need any help with the code.

Also keep in mind that this code was written when I was a sophomore/junior in college and I was just learning to code - as such a lot of the code might seem sloppy.
